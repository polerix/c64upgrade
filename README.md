## Build notes
- (add notes)
Here is the consolidated inventory of your DIY ribbon cable parts.

I have grouped similar items together and matched them with their likely **Adafruit Product IDs** (PID). Please double-check the cable lengths, as I assumed "mm" was likely a typo for "cm" given standard ribbon sizes (e.g., 30mm is only 3cm, which is unusually short).

### **HDMI Adapters**

### **Ribbon Cables (Flex)**

| Item Name | Total Count | Adafruit Part # | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **10cm Ribbon Cable** | **2** | [PID 3560](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3560) | (Listed as "110mm" in Box 2) |
| **30cm Ribbon Cable** | **5** | [PID 3562](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3562) | (Listed as "30mm" & "430mm"*) |
| **50cm Ribbon Cable** | **3** | [PID 3563](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3563) | (Listed as "150mm" in Box 2) |

**Note: For the cables, I assumed you meant **cm** or standard lengths (e.g., 10cm, 20cm, 50cm). If you actually have 30mm (3cm) cables, those are very rare custom parts!*

Would you like me to help you create a label for Box 12 (or whichever box you consolidate these into) with this full list?
